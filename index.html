            <p>Hello, I'm Barbara Tsitey, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science graduate with a Bachelor of
                Science degree from Miami University in Oxford, OH. I specialize in a diverse range of programming
                languages, including Java, C++, HTML/CSS, Python, R, Scheme, SQL, and C#. My educational journey has
                equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Web Application
                Programming, Systems Design, Algorithms, and more.</p>

            <p>I successfully graduated in December 2023, and my academic journey was complemented by a Humanitarian
                Minor, showcasing my commitment not only to technology but also to making a positive impact on society.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Education</h3>
            <p>One of my significant accomplishments was leading a team in the development of a Proactive Anti-cheat
                System for a first-person shooter (FPS) game during my Senior Capstone Design project. I implemented a
                robust defense strategy involving object concealment and counterfeit object generation, leveraging YOLO
                for object detection against Adversarial Attacks. This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in
                Unity, PyTorch, and project management using tools like Trello.</p>

            <p>I also engaged in research on the "Fidelity Of Simulation & Real Robots," where I explored sensor types
                and characterized Ultrasonic and IR-Sharp sensors using Arduino technology. Through this project, I
                honed my documentation skills and contributed to the team's understanding and implementation of various
                sensor types.</p>
